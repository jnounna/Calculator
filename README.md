# Calculator
## Overview

I made this project to learn about C# and to be able to learn how to navigate and 
use Visual Studio instead of VSCode.I know that in some industries Visual Studio gets 
used more and is easier to use for C#. The program that I made was just a basic Calculator app.
How I made it was first by making a form and adding buttons and a text box. Once I made those
I then made programmed the buttons so that when they get pressed they would display there number. Then 
After that you would press your operation button and it parses those numbers and then you put other numbers in 
and parse those and hit equal and it will do the math.

## Development Environment

.net 6
I used visual studio for the project so it might be the easiest to run it through that.
